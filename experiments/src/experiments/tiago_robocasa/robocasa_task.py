What Tiago's RoboCasa tasks share: a RoboCasa kitchen lowered to where Tiago reaches,
the robot standing in front of what it is to take hold of, and the whole thing carried
out against MuJoCo physics with nothing attached to the hand.

The kitchen, the objects and where they stand are RoboCasa's. Tiago replaces RoboCasa's
own robot, and every object it moves is held by the grip of its fingers alone.
