"""
The Toyota HSR performs RoboCasa's pick-and-place tasks in a RoboCasa kitchen,
simulated in MuJoCo: it picks an object up where the task puts it and sets it into the
receptacle the task names.

RoboCasa composes the kitchen and samples the objects; the HSR replaces the robot
RoboCasa would use. The object is held by nothing but the friction between it and the
fingers.

Run the stove task with::
