"""
The Toyota HSR picks a milk carton up from a table of the kitchen, drives along the
table carrying it over the cooktop, and sets it down on the cooktop's far side,
simulated in MuJoCo.

The kitchen is semantic_digital_twin's predetermined
:class:`~semantic_digital_twin.predefined_maps.kitchen_environment.KitchenEnvironment`.
The HSR's base, arm, head and hand are driven by servos, and the carton is held by
nothing but the friction between it and the fingers: it is neither moved under the hand
in the world model nor fastened to it in MuJoCo.

Run it with::

    python -m experiments.hsr_kitchen_mujoco.demo
